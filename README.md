# Election_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate using python for simple calculations on a large data set.  In business it is common to have simple questions that must be answered with a large amount of data.  In this review, we are looking at election data by candidate and by county.  We want to dertmine the winning candidate, the county with the most turn out, overall and percent of the votes received.

## Election-audit summary
With some modifications, we could use this script for other elections.  I believe we could add code to read other CSV files from other elections and merge them for a larger analysis.  We could follow that same logic and during the next election we could append the new years election data and compare candidate votes if they re-ran for election.  Lastly, the code can easily be run again now for a different election as long as the file paths are updated.
